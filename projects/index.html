			<h4>
				Understanding TrueSkill
			</h4>
			<p>
				I was interested in ranking players and Bayesian Machine Learning and
				implementing the original TrueSkill
			<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/NIPS2006_0688.pdf">
				paper
			</a>
			was a really fun way to do both.

			TrueSkill blog post
			</a>
			<br>
		I had to learn a lot of new stuff to understand the paper such as factor graphs and expectation
		propogation and how useful Gaussians are! One acid test for me to see if I've learnt something is to try explain
		it to someone else so I wrote an accompanying blog post explaining the theory and my motivations.

				Python implementation of TrueSkill
			</a>
			<br>
			I also implemented the paper in Python, please check it out, usual instructions in the README for usage.

		<h4>
			Analog RNN
		</h4>
		I'm always excited by seeing articles that tie together ML and Physics. This
		<a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/12/eaay6946/tab-pdf">
			paper
		</a>
		formulates the wave equation using RNN update equations and shows how you could design a manifold with a non-linear
		wave speed across it to classify vowels by measuring the energy at points on the manifold!

			Python implementation of Analog RNN - WIP

		I wanted to implement the method the authors talk about by building a custom model in Tensorflow.
