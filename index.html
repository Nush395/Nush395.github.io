	<h2 >Hi there, I'm Anushan (Ah-noo-shen) Fernando.</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
		Welcome!
        <br>
		<br>
		This is a personal website for me to write about cool stuff that I've encountered and hopefully might be
		of interest to you too! It's a little rough around the edges so apologies for that.
		If you'd like to check out some of my projects go <a href="/projects">here</a>.
		<br>
		<br>
        I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer working at
		<a href="https://www.secondmind.ai">Secondmind</a>. We apply research in Bayesian optimisation and
		probabilistic modelling to real-world problems.
		<br>
		<br>
		Outside of work I'm a member of <a href="https://for.ai">FOR.ai</a> where we discuss ideas and collaborate on
		projects. There's way too many interesting things happening in the field at the moment but I'm currently
		learning a lot about meta-learning and geometric deep learning.
