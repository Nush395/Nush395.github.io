<h2>
    Overview
</h2>
<p>
    This is a post to document the learnings I made on my several week journey to understanding the
    TrueSkill algorithm created by Microsoft Research for ranking teams of players in games. This post
    is an accompaniment to the <a href="https://github.com/Nush395/TrueSkill">library</a> I created
    where I replicated the
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/trueskilltm-a-bayesian-skill-rating-system/">
        original paper.
    </a>
    Along with the original paper another really helpful resource I found is this
    <a>
        article
    </a>
    by Jeff Moser which explains a lot of the detail behind the equations in the original paper.
